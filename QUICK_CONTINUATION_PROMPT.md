I'm continuing development on my ACC MCP server with OAuth authentication. We successfully implemented:

✅ **Working OAuth System**: 3-legged OAuth with browser integration
✅ **Dual Authentication**: Service account (automated) + OAuth (user-accountable) 
✅ **Forms Tool**: OAuth-enabled, tested and working
✅ **11 Service Account Tools**: Projects, files, issues, diagnostics all working
✅ **Clean Architecture**: Modular OAuth in `/src/utils/oauth.ts`, proper credential separation

**Current Setup:**
- Branch: `develop` (OAuth merged and pushed)
- Test Project: "Finlayson Test" (b.871ee5fd-e16f-47d9-8b73-9613637d1dac)
- OAuth callback: `http://localhost:8765/oauth/callback`
- Repository: https://github.com/Arborist-ai/acc-mcp-server

**Next Phase Goals:**
1. Test forms tool with real ACC forms data
2. Research & implement additional OAuth-required ACC APIs
3. Enhance OAuth system (token caching, refresh, better UX)
4. Add more construction management tools requiring user authentication

**Need help with:**
- Testing existing OAuth tools thoroughly
- Identifying which ACC APIs require OAuth vs service account
- Implementing new OAuth tools following established patterns
- Improving the authentication experience and error handling

Please help me continue expanding this construction management automation platform!
