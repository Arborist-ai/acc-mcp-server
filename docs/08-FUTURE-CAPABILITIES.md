## API Versioning and Migration Strategy

### Version Support Policy
- **Current Version**: Supported indefinitely
- **Previous Major Version**: 18 months support after new version release
- **Legacy Versions**: 6 months sunset notice

### Migration Best Practices
```javascript
class APIVersionManager {
  constructor() {
    this.supportedVersions = {
      issues: ['v1'],
      rfis: ['v2', 'v1'], // v1 deprecated but supported
      submittals: ['v1'],
      forms: ['v1']
    };
  }
  
  async migrateEndpoint(service, fromVersion, toVersion) {
    const migrationPlan = this.getMigrationPlan(service, fromVersion, toVersion);
    
    for (const step of migrationPlan.steps) {
      console.log(`Executing migration step: ${step.description}`);
      await step.execute();
    }
  }
  
  getMigrationPlan(service, fromVersion, toVersion) {
    // Return service-specific migration plans
    const migrations = {
      rfis: {
        'v1-to-v2': {
          steps: [
            {
              description: 'Update endpoint URLs from /v1/ to /v2/',
              execute: () => this.updateEndpointUrls('rfis', 'v1', 'v2')
            },
            {
              description: 'Update response parsing for new structure',
              execute: () => this.updateResponseParsing('rfis', 'v2')
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    };
    
    return migrations[service][`${fromVersion}-to-${toVersion}`];
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting Evolution

### Current Limits (2025)
- Standard: 100 requests/minute for GET, 50/minute for POST

### Planned Improvements (2025-2026)
- **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Limits adjust based on usage patterns
- **Service-Specific Limits**: Different limits per API service
- **Burst Capacity**: Allow temporary spikes above base limit
- **Priority Queuing**: Critical operations get priority

### Implementation Strategy
```javascript
class FutureRateLimiter {
  constructor() {
    this.adaptiveLimits = {
      current: 100,
      burst: 150,
      sustained: 80
    };
  }
  
  async requestWithAdaptiveLimit(operation) {
    const currentLoad = await this.getCurrentSystemLoad();
    const adjustedLimit = this.calculateAdaptiveLimit(currentLoad);
    
    return this.executeWithLimit(operation, adjustedLimit);
  }
  
  calculateAdaptiveLimit(systemLoad) {
    if (systemLoad < 0.5) {
      return this.adaptiveLimits.burst; // Allow burst during low load
    } else if (systemLoad > 0.8) {
      return this.adaptiveLimits.sustained; // Reduce during high load
    }
    return this.adaptiveLimits.current;
  }
}
```
