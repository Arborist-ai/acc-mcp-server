## Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Reliability First**: Construction management tools must be dependable
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all paths, especially error conditions
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Tests should reflect actual construction workflows
- **Documentation**: Every test should explain its purpose and context
- **Maintainability**: Tests should be easy to update as the system evolves

### Quality Standards
- Minimum 80% code coverage for critical paths
- 100% coverage for authentication and authorization
- All external API interactions must be mocked for unit tests
- Integration tests should validate actual API contracts
- Performance benchmarks for response times

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
Test individual functions and modules in isolation.

**Scope:**
- Tool schema validation
- Authentication token management
- Error handling logic
- Data transformation functions
- Utility functions

**Key Areas:**
- `auth.ts` - Token generation and validation
- `common.ts` - Shared tool utilities
- Individual tool implementations
- Configuration management

### 2. Integration Tests
Test interactions between modules and external services.

**Scope:**
- Authentication flow with Autodesk APIs
- Tool execution with mocked API responses
- Error propagation across modules
- Caching mechanisms

### 3. Contract Tests
Validate API contracts with Autodesk Construction Cloud.

**Scope:**
- Response schema validation
- API versioning compatibility
- Error response formats
- Rate limiting behavior

### 4. End-to-End Tests
Test complete workflows as used by construction managers.

**Scenarios:**
- Issue creation and tracking workflow
- Document upload and version management
- RFI submission and response cycle
- Submittal approval process
- Cross-tool data consistency

### 5. Performance Tests
Ensure acceptable response times for construction field use.

**Metrics:**
- Tool response time < 2 seconds
- Authentication caching effectiveness
- Concurrent request handling
- Memory usage under load

### 6. Security Tests
Validate authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Coverage:**
- Token expiration handling
- Scope validation
- Service account security
- OAuth flow security
- Credential storage safety

## Testing Infrastructure

### Test Runner Configuration
- **Primary**: Node.js built-in test runner (node:test)
- **Assertion Library**: Node.js assert with custom matchers
- **Mocking**: Built-in mock functionality + custom fixtures
- **Coverage**: c8 for code coverage reporting

### Test Data Management
- Fixture files for API responses
- Test project configurations
- Mock authentication tokens
- Sample construction data (issues, RFIs, etc.)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Set up test infrastructure
2. Create test helpers and utilities
3. Implement comprehensive mocking system
4. Configure coverage reporting
5. Create initial unit tests for critical paths

### Phase 2: Core Coverage (Week 2)
1. Unit tests for all tools
2. Authentication system tests
3. Error handling validation
4. Configuration management tests

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 3)
1. API interaction tests
2. Caching mechanism tests
3. Multi-tool workflow tests
4. Performance baseline tests

### Phase 4: Advanced Testing (Week 4)
1. Contract tests with API documentation
2. End-to-end scenario tests
3. Security validation
4. Load testing

## Test Coverage Targets

### Minimum Requirements
- Overall: 80% line coverage
- Critical paths: 95% coverage
- Authentication: 100% coverage
- Error handling: 100% coverage

### Tool-Specific Coverage
Each tool must have:
- Schema validation tests
- Success path tests
- Error condition tests
- Edge case tests
- Performance benchmarks

## Continuous Integration

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Linting (ESLint)
- Type checking (TypeScript)
- Unit test execution
- Coverage verification

### CI Pipeline
1. **Build Stage**
   - TypeScript compilation
   - Dependency validation

2. **Test Stage**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Coverage reporting

3. **Quality Gates**
   - Coverage thresholds
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Security scanning

### Deployment Validation
- Smoke tests after deployment
- API availability checks
- Authentication verification

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Test Maintenance
- Update tests when modifying code
- Review test failures before fixing code
- Keep fixtures current with API changes
- Document test purpose and context

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly: Review test coverage reports
- Quarterly: Update integration test scenarios
- Annually: Comprehensive test suite audit

### Best Practices
1. **Test Naming**: Use descriptive names that explain the scenario
2. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent
3. **Repeatability**: Tests must produce consistent results
4. **Speed**: Keep unit tests fast (< 100ms each)
5. **Documentation**: Include context for complex tests

### Debugging Failed Tests
1. Check test logs for detailed error information
2. Verify mock data matches current API contracts
3. Ensure environment variables are correctly set
4. Review recent code changes for impacts

## Construction-Specific Considerations

### Critical Workflows
These workflows require enhanced testing due to their importance in construction management:

1. **Issue Management**
   - Creation with all required fields
   - Assignment and status changes
   - Root cause analysis
   - Comment threads

2. **Document Control**
   - Version tracking
   - Access permissions
   - Folder structure integrity
   - File naming conventions

3. **RFI Processing**
   - Submission validation
   - Response tracking
   - Status updates
   - Notification handling

4. **Submittal Workflows**
   - Approval chains
   - Status transitions
   - Document attachments
   - Review comments

### Compliance Requirements
- Audit trail integrity
- Data retention verification
- Permission enforcement
- Regulatory compliance checks

## Reporting and Metrics

### Test Reports
- Daily: Unit test results
- Weekly: Coverage trends
- Monthly: Performance metrics
- Quarterly: Quality assessment

### Key Metrics
- Test execution time
- Coverage percentages
- Defect detection rate
- Test maintenance effort

## Emergency Procedures

### Test Failure Response
1. Immediate notification to development team
2. Root cause analysis within 4 hours
3. Fix or rollback decision
4. Post-mortem for critical failures

### Production Issues
- Correlation with test gaps
- Immediate test creation for issues
- Regression test suite updates
